# Wireless-Communation-Modulation-Classification-Through-2D-Histograms-and-CNNs

The purpose of this repository is to show the code I used to publish the results presented in the paper [Novel Deep-Learning Modulation Recognition Algorithm Using 2D Histograms over Wireless Communications Channels](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/13/9/1533).

The topic of the discussion is highlighted clealy in the paper. I wanted to make all information accessible to everyone. You can run the code by running the "six_mod_class_main_V3.m" file on MATLAB.
